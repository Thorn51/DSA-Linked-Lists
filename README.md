# Thinkful - Data Structures & Algorithms

## Working with Linked Lists

The drills in this section are completing using the following files:

- `linked-lis.js` - This file contains the private node class and the linked list class. All of the methods in the linked list class are from the curriculum or from the drills.
- `main.js` - This file contains function calls to test the various methods completed in the drills

The code in these files is littered with console logs. In a normal working environment these would be removed, but in this case they are intentionally left in for illustrative purposes to help learn the content.

The `main.js` file contains various functions for the different drills. Each function has a call at the end of the file. These are commented out to clear up the console. If you are using this to learn the content it might be useful to uncomment those calls.

## Drills

Environment -> https://thorn51.github.io/DSA-Linked-Lists/

The environment goes over the construction of the array class. It then has a series of drills that were attempted in this module.

If the drills don't have answers then they are incomplete and are still in the process of being worked on.
